#Brain MRI U-NET based cancer segmentation

The project aims to create a segmentation model using U-NET architecture for segmenting cancer area on the MRI images of brain. Model is developed from scratch using Tensorflow framework. The used dataset for project is received from kaggle and the steps for download is mentioned in Download Kaggle dataset section of train.ipynb file. 

The validation result of the model was 0.994 accuracy. The test results of the model can be seen using the "visualize" function.
